Getting Started with React

1. Install Node.js locally by downloading it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. From the Terminal, Command Prompt, etc. update Node Package Manager by typing the command: npm install npm –g
3. Install the create-react-app package by typing the command: npm install –g create-react-app
4. Create a new folder or directory for your project, then navigate to it using Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.
5. Create the project by typing the command: create-react-app lists
6. This will create a “lists” directory and install the default React app there. You can start it by changing to the “lists” directory and typing the command: npm start
7. You should then be able to access http://localhost:3000 using your web browser and see the default React app. If so, you’re ready to proceed.
